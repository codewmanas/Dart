# Introduction to Dart

Dart is a client-optimized programming language for fast apps on any platform. It is developed by Google and is used to build mobile, desktop, server, and web applications. Dart is an object-oriented, class-based language with C-style syntax.

## Features of Dart

- **Optimized for UI**: Dart is designed for building user interfaces, offering features like hot reload for quick iterations.
- **Productive Development**: Dart's syntax is easy to learn, and it provides powerful tools for development.
- **Fast on All Platforms**: Dart compiles to ARM and x64 machine code for mobile, desktop, and backend. For web, Dart compiles to JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To start using Dart, you need to install the Dart SDK. You can download it from the [official Dart website](https://dart.dev/get-dart).

## First Program in Dart: Hello World

Below is a simple Dart program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

```dart
void main() {
    print('Hello, World!');
}
```

To run this program, save it in a file with a `.dart` extension and execute it using the Dart SDK:

```sh
dart filename.dart
```

This will output:

```
Hello, World!
```

Happy coding with Dart!
