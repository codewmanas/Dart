# Operators in Dart

Operators are special symbols that are used to perform operations on variables and values. Dart supports a rich set of operators, which can be categorized as follows:

## Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.

| Operator | Description          | Example       |
|----------|----------------------|---------------|
| `+`      | Addition             | `a + b`       |
| `-`      | Subtraction          | `a - b`       |
| `*`      | Multiplication       | `a * b`       |
| `/`      | Division             | `a / b`       |
| `~/`     | Integer Division     | `a ~/ b`      |
| `%`      | Modulus (Remainder)  | `a % b`       |
| `++`     | Increment            | `a++` or `++a`|
| `--`     | Decrement            | `a--` or `--a`|

## Equality and Relational Operators
These operators are used to compare two values.

| Operator | Description          | Example       |
|----------|----------------------|---------------|
| `==`     | Equal to             | `a == b`      |
| `!=`     | Not equal to         | `a != b`      |
| `>`      | Greater than         | `a > b`       |
| `<`      | Less than            | `a < b`       |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal| `a >= b`      |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal   | `a <= b`      |

## Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine multiple boolean expressions.

| Operator | Description          | Example       |
|----------|----------------------|---------------|
| `&&`     | Logical AND          | `a && b`      |
| `||`     | Logical OR           | `a || b`      |
| `!`      | Logical NOT          | `!a`          |

## Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

| Operator | Description          | Example       |
|----------|----------------------|---------------|
| `=`      | Assign               | `a = b`       |
| `+=`     | Add and assign       | `a += b`      |
| `-=`     | Subtract and assign  | `a -= b`      |
| `*=`     | Multiply and assign  | `a *= b`      |
| `/=`     | Divide and assign    | `a /= b`      |
| `~/=`    | Integer divide and assign | `a ~/= b` |
| `%=`     | Modulus and assign   | `a %= b`      |

## Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators perform bit-level operations on integer values.

| Operator | Description          | Example       |
|----------|----------------------|---------------|
| `&`      | Bitwise AND          | `a & b`       |
| `|`      | Bitwise OR           | `a | b`       |
| `^`      | Bitwise XOR          | `a ^ b`       |
| `~`      | Bitwise NOT          | `~a`          |
| `<<`     | Left shift           | `a << b`      |
| `>>`     | Right shift          | `a >> b`      |

## Conditional Operators
Conditional operators are used to evaluate expressions based on a condition.

| Operator | Description          | Example       |
|----------|----------------------|---------------|
| `?:`     | Ternary operator     | `a ? b : c`   |
| `??`     | If null              | `a ?? b`      |

## Type Test Operators
Type test operators are used to check the type of an object.

| Operator | Description          | Example       |
|----------|----------------------|---------------|
| `is`     | Type check           | `a is Type`   |
| `is!`    | Not type check       | `a is! Type`  |

## Conclusion
Dart provides a comprehensive set of operators to perform various operations on data. Understanding these operators is crucial for effective programming in Dart.
