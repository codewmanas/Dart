## Why Dart? 

Dart is:
- **Optimized for UI development**: Itâ€™s the foundation of Flutter, enabling smooth and beautiful UIs.
- **Fast**: Dart is compiled to native code for incredible performance.
- **Productive**: With features like hot-reload and a concise syntax, Dart makes development faster and more enjoyable.
- **Flexible**: Write apps for mobile, web, server, and even desktop!
